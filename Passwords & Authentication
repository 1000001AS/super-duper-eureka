Passwords are your first line of defense. Strong passwords and extra security steps help keep your accounts safe.

## Tips for Strong Passwords
- Use at least 12 characters
- Mix letters, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid using names, birthdays, or common words

What Is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?
MFA adds a second layer of securityâ€”like a code sent to your phone or fingerprint scan.

Tools You Can Use
- Password managers (e.g., Bitwarden, LastPass)
- MFA apps (e.g., Authy, Microsoft Authenticator)

Key Takeaway
Strong passwords + MFA = safer accounts.
