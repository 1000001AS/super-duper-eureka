Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting your devices, accounts, and personal information from digital threats like hackers, viruses, and scams.

Why It Matters
- Your phone, computer, and online accounts hold sensitive data.
- Cybercriminals can steal your identity, money, or private information.
- Staying safe online helps protect your family, workplace, and community.

Real-Life Example
Imagine someone gets access to your email and resets your bank password. That’s why cybersecurity is important—it’s your digital lock and key.

Key Takeaway
Cybersecurity is for everyone. You don’t need to be a tech expert to stay safe online.
