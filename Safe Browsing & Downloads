The internet is full of useful resources—but also risky websites and downloads.

Safe Browsing Habits
- Look for HTTPS in the URL (the “lock” symbol)
- Avoid clicking pop-ups or ads that seem too good to be true
- Don’t download software from random websites

Example
A free movie download site might install malware on your computer. Stick to trusted platforms.

Key Takeaway
Think before you click. Safe browsing protects your device and your data.
