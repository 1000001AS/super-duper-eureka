Phishing is when someone tries to trick you into giving away personal info—usually through fake emails or messages.

How to Spot a Scam
- Urgent tone: “Your account will be locked!”
- Suspicious links or attachments
- Requests for passwords or financial info

What to Do
- Don’t click links or download attachments from unknown senders
- Verify with the company directly
- Report the message to your email provider or IT team

Key Takeaway
If it feels off, it probably is. Trust your instincts.
